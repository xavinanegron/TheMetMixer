# The Met Mixer- A Vanilla JavaScript App

App that generates random artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection in New York City along with a description. This project demonstrates how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript to connect to a public API and update the webpage's content dynamically.

## Key JavaScript Concepts Covered

**Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Utilizes async/await for asynchronous API calls to the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API. <br>

**Advanced Event Handling:** Employs event handling strategies to manage user interactions, such as viewing artwork details, enhancing the application's interactivity and usability. <br>

**DOM Manipulation:** Demonstrates proficiency in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically render artwork details, creating an engaging user experience. <br>

**Error Handling and User Feedback:** Implements error handling mechanisms to manage potential API request failures or user input errors, providing clear feedback to users and ensuring the application's reliability. <br>
